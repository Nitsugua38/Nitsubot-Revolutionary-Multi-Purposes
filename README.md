# RevolutionaryDiscordBot
A Revolutionary Discord Bot with redesigned features

Commands :
`/msg` - The bot sends a message to a user in the guild. You can define if he sends either your name or only the name of the guild or… nothing ! Like an anonymous message !
`/tempchannel` - The bot creates a voice channel for you which can be deleted in one click (even if you are just a member without any permissions !). Note : the moderators have to define the category where to create the voice channel using `/config tempchannel`.
`/play` - A revolutionary way to listen to music in a voice channel with one command and buttons which allow you to add to music queue, pause, skip, see lyrics, see queue and stop when you’re done!
`/kick` and `/ban` - Basics. Allow you to send a message to the user at the same time!

Loads of other features will be available soon as this project is in development and all in a more modern, comfortable and revolutionary way than the other bots !

Bot is currently in French but will be available in English soon !
